Verse 1
WE'LL WORK TILL JESUS COMES
O land of rest for thee I sigh!
When will the moment come

When I shall lay my armor by
And dwell in peace at home?

Chorus 
We'll work till Jesus comes,
We'll work till Jesus comes;
And we'll be gathered home.

Verse 2
To Jesus Christ I fled for rest;
He bade me cease to roam,

And lean for succor on His breast
Till He conduct me home.

Verse 3
I sought at once my Saviour's side,
No more my steps shall roam;

With Him I'll brave death's chilling tide,
And reach my heavenly home.
