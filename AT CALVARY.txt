Verse 1
AT CALVARY
Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,

Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.
  
Chorus
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;

There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.
  
Verse 2
By God’s Word at last my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned,

Till my guilty soul im-plor-ing turned to Calvary.
  
Verse 3
Now I’ve given to Je-sus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,

Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary!
  
Verse 4
Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man! 

Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!
