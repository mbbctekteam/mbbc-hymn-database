GREAT IS THY FAITHFULNESS

Verse 1
Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;
There is no shadow of turning with Thee.

Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;
As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.

Chorus
Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see;

All I have needed Thy hand hath provided,
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.

Verse 2
Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,

join with all nature in manifold witness to
Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

Verse 3
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide,

Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings, all mine, with ten thousand beside!
