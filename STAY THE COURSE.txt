STAY THE COURSE

Verse 1
I am resolved no longer to linger
Charmed by the world's delight

Things that are higher things that are nobler
These have allured my sight!

Chorus
Jesus, You are the highest and best,
I'll follow You forsaking the rest.

I'll stay the course, no matter the test

Verse 2
I am resolved to follow the Saviour
Faithful and true each day.

Heed what He says and do what He willeth
He is the living way!

Verse 3
I am resolved and who will go with me?
Come friends without delay!

Taught by the Bible led by the Spirit,
We'll walk the Heavn'ly way!
