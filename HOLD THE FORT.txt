HOLD THE FORT 

Verse 1
Ho, my comrades, see the signal, waving in the sky!

Reinforcements now appearing, victory is nigh.

Chorus
“Hold the fort, for I am coming,” Jesus signals still;

Wave the answer back to heaven, “By Thy grace we will.”

Verse 2
See the mighty host advancing, Satan leading on,

Mighty ones around us falling, courage almost gone!

Verse 3
See the glorious banner waving, Hear the trumpet blow!

In our Leader’s Name we triumph over every foe.

Verse 4
Fierce and long the battle rages, but our help is near,

Onward comes our great Commander, cheer, my comrades, cheer!
