RESCUE THE PERSIHING

Verse 1
Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;

Weep oâ€™er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.

Chorus
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;

Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

Verse 2
Though they are slighting Him, Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;

Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Verse 3
Down in the human heart, Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;

Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.

Verse 4
Rescue the perishing, Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;

Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
Tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
