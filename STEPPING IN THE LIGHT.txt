STEPPING IN THE LIGHT

Verse 1
Trying to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Trying to follow our Savior and King;

Shaping our lives by His blessèd example,
Happy, how happy, the songs that we bring.

Chorus
How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Stepping in the light, stepping in the light,

How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Led in paths of light.

Verse 2
Pressing more closely to Him Who is leading,
When we are tempted to turn from the way;

Trusting the arm that is strong to defend us,
Happy, how happy, our praises each day.

Verse 3
Walking in footsteps of gentle forbearance,
Footsteps of faithfulness, mercy, and love,

Looking to Him for the grace freely promised,
Happy, how happy, our journey above.

Verse 4
Trying to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Upward, still upward, we follow our Guide;

When we shall see Him, “the King in His beauty,”
Happy, how happy, our place at His side.
