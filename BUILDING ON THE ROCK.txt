Verse 1
Building on the Rock
I builded on the Rock, on the Rock of God,
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
I dug down deep and builded on the Rock,
Builded on the Rock of God.

Chorus
I hold not the Rock, but the Rock holds me,
The Rock holds me, the Rock holds me;
I rest on the Rock, and the Rock holds me,
Resting on the Rock of God.

Verse 2
Why should I fear when the winds sweep by?
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Or shaken be when the waves roll high?
Builded on the Rock of God.

Verse 3
Hush, raging billows at His command,
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Oh, peace be still â€™neath His loving hand!
Builded on the Rock of God.

Verse 4
Praise God for our foundation sure!
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
No storms can harm our home secure,
Builded on the Rock of God.
