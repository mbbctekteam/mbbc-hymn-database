I AM RESOLVED

Verse 1
I am resolved no longer to linger,
Charmed by the world’s delight,

Things that are higher, things that are nobler,
These have allured my sight.

Chorus
I will hasten to Him, hasten so glad and free;
Jesus, greatest, highest, I will come to Thee.

Verse 2
I am resolved to go to the Savior,
Leaving my sin and strife;

He is the true One, He is the just One,
He hath the words of life.

Verse 3
I am resolved to follow the Savior,
Faithful and true each day;

Heed what He sayeth, do what He willeth,
He is the living Way.

Verse 4
I am resolved to enter the kingdom
Leaving the paths of sin;

Friends may oppose me, foes may beset me,
Still will I enter in.

Verse 5
I am resolved, and who will go with me?
Come, friends, without delay,

Taught by the Bible, led by the Spirit,
We’ll walk the heav’nly way.
