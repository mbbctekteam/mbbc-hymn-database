MAKE ME A BLESSING

Verse 1
Out in the highways and byways of life, many are weary and sad;

Carry the sunshine where darkness is rife, making the sorrowing glad.

Chorus
Make me a blessing, Make me a blessing, Out of my life, May Jesus shine;

Make me a blessing, O Savior, I pray, Make me a blessing to someone today.

Verse 2
Tell the sweet story of Christ and His love; Tell of His power to forgive;

Others will trust Him if only you prove through every moment you live.

Verse 3
Give as 'twas given to you in your need; Love as the Master, loved you,

Be to the helpless a helper indeed; Unto your mission be true.
