DRAW ME NEARER

Verse 1
I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice, and it told Thy love to me;

But I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to Thee.

Chorus
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross  that Thou hast died;

Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to Thy precious bleeding side .

Verse 2
Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord, by the power of grace divine;

Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope and my will be lost in Thine.

Verse 3
O the pure delight of a single hour, that before Thy throne I spend;

When I kneel in prayer and with Thee, my God, I commune as friend with friend!

Verse 4
There are depths of love that I cannot know till I cross the narrow sea;

There are heights of joy that I may not reach till I rest in peace with Thee.
