I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED

Verse 1
I know not why God’s wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,

Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

Chorus
But I know Whom I have believèd,
And am persuaded that He is able

To keep that which I’ve committed
Unto Him against that day.

Verse 2
I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,

Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

Verse 3
I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing us of sin,

Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

Verse 4
I know not what of good or 
ill may be reserved for me,

Of weary ways or golden days,
before His face I see.

Verse 5
I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,

Nor if I walk the vale with Him,
I'll meet Him in the air.
