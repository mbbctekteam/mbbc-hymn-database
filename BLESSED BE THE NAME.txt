BLESSED BE THE NAME

Verse 1
All praise to Him Who reigns above
In majesty supreme,

Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem!

Chorus
Blessèd be the Name! Blessèd be the Name!
Blessèd be the Name of the Lord!

Blessèd be the Name! Blessèd be the Name!
Blessèd be the Name of the Lord!

Verse 2
His Name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,

At God the Father’s own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

Verse 3
Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man
Once ruined by the fall,

Thou hast devised salvation’s plan,
For Thou hast died for all.

Verse 4
His Name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace,

Of all earth’s kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.
