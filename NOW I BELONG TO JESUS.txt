NOW I BELONG TO JESUS

Verse 1
Jesus my Lord will love me forever
From Him no pow'r of evil can sever

He gave His life to ransom my soul,
Now I belong to Him;

Chorus
Now I belong to Jesus 
Jesus belongs to me
Not for the years of time alone But for eternity

Verse 2
Once I was lost in sin's degradation 
Jesus came down to bring me salvation

Lifted me up from sorrow and shame 
Now I belong to Him

Verse 3
Joy floods my soul for Jesus has saved me
Freed me from sin that sin that long Had enslaved me

His precious blood he gave to redeem
Now I belong to Him;
