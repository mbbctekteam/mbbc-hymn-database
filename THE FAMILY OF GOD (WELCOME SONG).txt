"The Family of God"

I'm so glad I'm a part
of the family of God-
I've been washed in the fountain,

cleansed by His blood!
Joint heirs with Jesus
as we travel this sod,

For I'm part of the family,
the family of God.

You will notice we say 'brother
and sister' 'round here-

It's because we're a family
and these folks are so near;

When one has a heartache
we all share the tears,

And rejoice in each victory
In this family so dear.
