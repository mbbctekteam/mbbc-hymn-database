THIS IS MY FATHER'S WORLD

Verse 1 
This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears
all nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres.

This is my Father's world, I rest me in the thought
of rocks and trees, of skies and seas, His hand the wonders wrought.

Verse 2 
This is my Father's world, The birds their carols raise;
The morning light, the lily white, declare their Maker's praise.

This is my Father's world, He shines in all that's fair,
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass, He speaks to me everywhere.

Verse 3 
This is my Father's world, O let me ne'er forget
that though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the Ruler yet.

This is my Father's world, The battle is not done;
Jesus Who died shall be satisfied and earth and heaven be one.
