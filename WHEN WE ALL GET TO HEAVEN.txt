WHEN WE ALL GET TO HEAVEN

Verse 1
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
Sing His mercy and His grace

In the mansion bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place

Chorus
When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be

When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory

Verse 2
While we walk the pilgrim pathway
Clouds will over spread sky

But when trav'ling days are over
Not a shadow not a sigh

Verse 3
Let us then be true and faithful
Trusting serving every day

Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay

Verse 4
Onward to the prize before us
Soon His beauty we'll behold

Soon the pearly gate will open
We shall tread the streets of gold
