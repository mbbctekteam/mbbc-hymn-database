COME THOU FOUNT

Verse 1
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;

Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above.

Praise the mount! I’m fixed upon it,
Mount of Thy redeeming love.

Verse 2
Here I raise my Ebenezer;
Here by Thy great help I’ve come;

And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safey to arrive at home.

Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand'ring from the fold of God;

He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

Verse 3
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’m constrained to be!

Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;

Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.

Verse 4
O that day when freed from sinning,
I shall see Thy lovely face;

Clothed then in blood washed linen
How I’ll sing Thy sovereign grace;

Come, my Lord, no longer tarry,
Take my ransomed soul away;

Send thine angels now to carry
Me to realms of endless day.
