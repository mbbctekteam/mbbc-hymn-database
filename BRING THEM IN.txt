BRING THEM IN

Verse 1
Hark! tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,

Out in the desert dark and drear,

Calling the sheep who've gone astray 

Far from the Shepherd's fold away

Chorus
Bring them in,
Bring them in

Bring them in From the fields of sin;

Bring them in,
Bring them in,

Bring the wand'ring to Jesus

Verse 2
Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,

Help Him the wand'ring ones to find?

Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold?

Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Verse 3
Out in the desert hear their cry

Out on the mountains wild and high;

Hark! tis the Master speaks to thee,

“Go find the sheep where'er they be.”
