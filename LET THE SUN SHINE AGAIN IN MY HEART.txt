Verse 1
Let the Sun Shine Again in My Heart
I remember the time when I first knew the Savior,
When the sunlight of blessing so flooded my heart,
O the sweetness of "first love," with Jesus so near me,
and I thought such devotion would never depart.

Chorus
Let the sunshine again, Let the flow'rs bloom again;
Stir the embers of love in my heart!
Holy Spirit reprove, then embrace me again;
Let the sunshine again in my heart!

Verse 2
Then how sweet were the Scriptures, they spoke to me daily,
How they guided my steps; but my zeal did not last,
And the sweet place of pray'r where I met with my Savior,
I neglected, and so soon my joys were all past.

Verse 3
O, I loved well to walk in the way with God's children,
When we met with glad heart in a fellowship sweet.
But the pull of the flesh and some worldly companions,
In the paths of sin's pleasure attracted my feet.

Verse 4
Lord, I come now again for forgiveness and blessing,
As Thy penitent child I am seeking Thy peace.
For the blood paid my debt and Thy Spirit within me,
Bids me come to my Father, my wand'ring to cease.
