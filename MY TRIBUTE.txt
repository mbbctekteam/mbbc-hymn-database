MY TRIBUTE

Verse 1
How can I say thanks
For the things You have done for me?

Things so undeserved
Yet You gave to prove Your love for me

The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude

All that I am and ever hope to be
I owe it all to Thee

Chorus 
To God be the glory
To God be the glory

To God be the glory
For the things He has done

With His blood He has saved me
With His power He has raised me

To God be the glory
For the things He has done

Verse 2
Oh, let me live my life
Let it be pleasing, Lord to Thee

And if I gain any praise
Let it go to Calvary

With His blood He has saved me 
With His power He has raised me

To God be the glory 
For the things He has done

For the things He has done
