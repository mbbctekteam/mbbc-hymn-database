Look to the Lamb of God.

Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,

For He alone is able to save you,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Look to the Lamb of God;

You, in His strength shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary, does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;

His love will cheer and fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows on your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;

In joy or sorrow Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God.
