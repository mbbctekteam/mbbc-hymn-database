TO THE WORK

Verse 1 
To the work! to the work! we are servants of God,

Let us follow the path that our Master has trod;

With the balm of His counsel our strength to renew,

let us do with our might what our hands find to do.

Chorus
Toiling on; toiling on, toiling on, toiling on;

Let us hope, let us watch, and labor till the Master comes.

Verse 2 
To the work! to the work! let the hungry be fed;

to the fountain of life let the weary be led.

In the cross and its banner our glory shall be,

while we herald the tidings, "Salvation is free!"

Verse 3 
To the work! to the work! there is labor for all,

for the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall;

and the name of Jehovah exalted shall be

in the loud, swelling chorus, "Salvation is free!"

Verse 4 
To the work! to the work! in the strength of the Lord,

and a robe and a crown shall our labor reward

when the home of the faithful our dwelling shall be

and we shout with the ransomed, "Salvation is free!"
