Verse 1
I’ll Wish I Had Given Him More
By and by when I look on His face,
Beautiful face, thorn-shadowed face;

By and by when I look on His face,
I’ll wish I had given Him more
More, so much more 

More of my love than I e’er gave before.
By and by when I look on His face,

I’ll wish I had given Him more.

Verse 2
By and by when He holds out His hands,
Welcoming hands, nail riven hands;

By and by when He holds out His hands,
I’ll wish I had given Him more.
More, so much more,

More of my love than I e’er gave before,
By and by when He holds out His hands,

I’ll wish I had given Him more.

Verse 3
In the light of that heavenly place,
Light from His face, beautiful face;

In the light of that heavenly place,
I’ll wish I had given Him more.
More, so much more,

Treasures unbounded for Him I adore,
By and by when I look on His face,

I’ll wish I had given Him more
