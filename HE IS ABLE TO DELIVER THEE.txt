HE IS ABLE TO DELIVER THEE

Verse 1
'Tis the grandest theme through the ages rung
'Tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue;

'Tis the grandest theme that world's e'er sung,
"Our God is able to deliver thee."

Chorus
He is able to deliver thee, He is able to deliver thee;

Though by sin oppressed, Go to Him for rest;
"Our God is able to deliver thee."

Verse 2
'Tis the grandest theme in the earth or main;
'Tis the grandest theme for a mortal strain;

'Tis the grandest theme, tell the world again,
"Our God is able to deliver thee."

Verse 3
'Tis the grandest theme, let the tidings roll
to the guilty heart, to the sinful soul;

Look to God in faith, He will make thee whole,
"Our God is able to deliver thee."
