THE FIGHT IS ON

Verse 1
The fight is on, the trumpet sound is ringging out,
The cry “To arms!” is heard afar and near;

The Lord of hosts is marching on to victory,
The triumph of the Christ will soon appear.

Chorus
The fight is on, O Christian soldier,
And face to face in stern array,

With armor gleaming, and colors streaming,
The right and wrong engage today!

The fight is on, but be not weary;
Be strong, and in His might hold fast;

If God be for us, His banner o’er us,
We'll sing the victor song at last.

Verse 2
The fight is on, arouse, ye soldiers brave and true!
Jehovah leads, and victory will assure;

Go buckle on the armor God has given you,
And in His strength unto the end endure.

Verse 3
The Lord is leading on to certain victory;
The bow of promise spans the eastern sky;

His glorious Name in every land shall honored be;
The morn will break, the dawn of peace is nigh.
