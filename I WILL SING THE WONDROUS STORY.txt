I WILL SING THE WONDROUS STORY

Verse 1  
I will sing the wondrous story 
of the Christ Who died for me,

how He left His home in glory
for to die on Calvary.

Chorus
Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
of the Christ Who died for me,

Sing it with the saints in glory, 
gathered by the crystal sea.

Verse 2  
I was lost, but Jesus found me,
found the sheep that went astray,

threw His loving arms around me,
drew me back in to His way.

Verse 3  
I was bruised, but Jesus healed me; 
faint was I from many a fall,

sight was gone, and fears possessed me,
but He freed me from them all.

Verse 4 
Days of darkness still come o'er me,
sorrow's paths I often tread;

But the Savior still is with me,
by His hand I'm safely led.

Verse 5 
He will keep me till the river
rolls its waters at my feet,

then He'll bear me safely over,
where the loved ones I shall meet.
