GLORY TO HIS NAME

Verse 1
Down at the cross where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,

There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to his name!

Chorus
Glory to his name,
Glory to his name;

There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to his name!

Verse 2
I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;

There at the cross where he took me in;
Glory to his name!

Verse 3
Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;

There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
Glory to his name!

Verse 4
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet,
Cast thy poor soul at the Saviorâ€™s feet;

Plunge in today, and be made complete;
Glory to his name!
