Verse 1
SET MY SOUL AFIRE
Set my soul afire Lord
For Thy Holy Word
Burn it deep within me
Let Your voice be heard

Millions grope in darkness
In this day and hour
I will be a witness
Fill me with Thy pow'r

Chorus
Set my soul afire Lord
Set my soul afire
Make my life a witness
Of Thy saving pow'r

Millions grope in darkness
Waiting for Thy Word
Set my soul afire
Lord set my soul afire

Verse 2
Set my soul afire Lord
For the lost in sin
Give to me a passion
As I seek to win

Help not to falter
Never let me fail
Fill me with Thy Spirit
Let Thy will prevail

Verse 3

Set my soul afire Lord
In my daily life
Far too long I've wandered
In this day of strife

Nothing else will matter
But to live for Thee
I will be Your witness
As You live in me
