GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLDS

Verse 1
Far, far away, in death and darkness dwelling,
Millions of souls forever may be lost;

Who, who will go, salvation’s story telling,
Looking to Jesus, heeding not the cost?

Chorus
“All pow’r is given unto Me,
All pow’r is given unto Me,

Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,
And lo, I am with you alway.”

Verse 2
See o’er the world wide open doors inviting,
Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!

Christians, awake! your forces all uniting,
Send forth the gospel, break the chains of sin.

Verse 3
“Why will ye die?” the voice of God is calling;
“Why will you die?” re-echo in His name;

Jesus has died to save from death appalling,
Life and salvation, therefore, go proclaim.

Verse 4
God speed the day, when those of every nation
"Glory to God!" triumphantly shall sing;

Ransomed, redeemed, rejoicing in salvation,
Shout Hallelujah, for the Lord is King.
