ONWARD, CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS

Verse 1 
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,
with the cross of Jesus going on before,

Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe;
forward into battle, see His banners go.

Chorus
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching at to war,
with the cross of Jesus going on before.

Verse 2 
Like a mighty army moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.

We are not divided, all one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

Verse 3 
Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane,
but the Church of Jesus constant will remain.

Gates of hell can never against that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, which can never fail.

Verse 4 
Onward, then, ye people, join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song.

Glory, laud and honor unto Christ the King;
This through countless ages men and angels sing.
