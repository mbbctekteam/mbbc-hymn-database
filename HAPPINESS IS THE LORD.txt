HAPPINESS IS THE LORD

Verse 1
Happiness is to know the Saviour,
Living a life within His favour,

Having a change in my behaviour,
Happiness is the Lord.

Chorus
Real joy is mine,
No matter if the teardrops start,

I've found a secret,
It's Jesus in my heart.

Verse 2
Happiness is a new creation,
Jesus and me in close relation,

Having a part in His salvation,
Happiness is the Lord.

Verse 3
Happiness is to be forgiven
Living a life that's worth the Living

Taking a trip that leads to heaven 
Happiness is the Lord

Happiness is the Lord
