FAITH OF OUR FATHER'S

Verse 1
Faith of our fathers, living still,
In spite of dungeon, fire, and sword;

Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene’er we hear that glorious Word!

Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

Verse 2
Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free;

How sweet would be their children’s fate,
If they, like them, could die for thee!

Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

Verse 3
Faith of our fathers, we will strive
To win all nations unto thee;

And through the truth that comes from God,
We all shall then be truly free.

Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

Verse 4
Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;

And preach thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.

Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
