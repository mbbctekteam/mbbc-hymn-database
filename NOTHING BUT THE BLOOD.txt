NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD

Verse 1 
What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Chorus
Oh! precious is the flow that makes me white as snow;

No other fount I know, Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Verse 2 
For my pardon this I see Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

For my cleansing, this my plea, Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Verse 3 
Nothing can for sin atone, Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

Naught of good that I have done, Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Verse 4 
This is all my hope and peace, Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

This is all my righteousness, Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
