1 Jesus is all the world to me,
My life, my joy, my all;

He is my strength from day to day,
Without him I would fall:

When I am sad, to him I go,
No other one can cheer me so;

When I am sad, he makes me glad,
He's my friend.

2 Jesus is all the world to me,
My friend in trials sore;

I go to him for blessings, and
He gives them o'er and o'er:

He sends the sunshine and the rain,
He sends the harvest's golden grain;

Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain,
He's my friend.

3 Jesus is all the world to me,
And true to him I'll be;

Oh, how could I this friend deny,
When he's so true to me?

Following him I know I'm right,
He watches o'er me day and night;

Following him by day and night,
He's my friend.

4 Jesus is all the world to me,
I want no better friend;

I trust him now, I'll trust him when
Life's fleeting days shall end:

Beautiful life with such a friend,
Beautiful life that has no end;

Eternal life, eternal joy,
He's my friend.
