WHAT A DAY THAT WILL BE

Verse 1
There is coming a day when no heartaches shall come
No more clouds in the sky, no tears to dim the eye
All is peace forever more on that happy golden shore
What  a day glorious day that will be.

Chorus
What a day that will be, when my Jesus I shall see
And  I look upon His face the one who saves me by His grace
When he takes me by the hand and feeds me thru the promise land
What a day glorious day that will be

Verse 2
Thereâ€™ll be no sorrow there, no more burden to bear
No more sickness no more pain, no more parting over there
And forever I will be with the one who died for me
What a day glorious day that will be

Chorus
What a day that will be, when my Jesus I shall see
And  I look upon His face the one who saves me by His grace
When he takes me by the hand and feeds me thru the promise land
What a day glorious day that will be

What a day glorious day that will be...
