Refrain: (sing first refrain twice)
Ev'rybody ought to know,
Ev'rybody ought to know,
Ev'rybody ought to know Who Jesus is.

1 He's the Lily of the Valley,
He's the Bright and Morning Star;
He's the fairest of ten thousand,
Ev'rybody ought to know. [Refrain]

2 On the cross He died for sinners,
And His blood makes white as snow;
Loving, living, coming Saviorâ€”
He's the one you ought to know. [Refrain]
