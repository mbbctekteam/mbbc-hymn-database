EV'RYBODY OUGHT TO KNOW

Verse 1
Ev'rybody ought to know,
Ev'rybody ought to know,

Ev'rybody ought to know 
Who Jesus is.

Refrain
He's the Lily of the Valley,
He's the Bright and Morning Star;

He's the fairest of ten thousand,
Ev'rybody ought to know.

Verse 2
On the cross He died for sinners,
And His blood makes white as snow;

Loving, living, coming Savior
He's the one you ought to know.
