Verse 1
THE OLD ACCOUNT SETTLED
There was a time on earth,
When in the book of heaven,

An old account was standing
For sins yet unforgiven;
  
My name was at the top
And many things below,

I went unto the Keeper,
And settled long ago.
  
Chorus
Long ago, long ago,
Yes, the old account was settled long ago;
 
And the record’s clear today,
For He washed my sins away,

When the old account was settled long ago.
  
Verse 2
The old account was large,
And growing every day,

For I was always sinning,
And never tried to pay;
  
  
But when I looked ahead
And saw such pain and woe,

I said that I would settle,
And settled long ago.
  
Verse 3
When at the judgment bar
I stand before my King,

And He the book will open,
He cannot find a thing;
  
Then will my heart be glad,
While tears of joy will flow,

Because I had it settled,
And settled long ago.
  
Verse 4
O sinner, seek the Lord,
Repent of all your sin;

For thus He has commanded,
If you would enter in;
  
And then if you should live
A hundred years below,

E'en here you’ll not regret it,
You settled long ago.
