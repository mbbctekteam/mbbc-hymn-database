HE KEEPS ME SINGING

Verse 1
There's within my heart a melody Jesus whispers sweet and low,

fear not, I am with thee, peace, be still, in all of life's ebb and flow.

Chorus
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Sweetest name I know,

Fills my every longing, keeps me singing as I go.

Verse 2
All my life was wrecked by sin and strife, Discord filled my heart with pain;

Jesus swept across the broken strings, stirred the slumbering chords again.

Verse 3 
Feasting on the riches of His grace, Resting 'neath His sheltering wing,

Always looking to His gracious face, That is why I shout and sing.

Verse 4
Though sometimes He leads through waters deep, Trials fall across the way,

Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep, See His footprints all the way.
