THE FAMILY OF GOD

VERSE 1
You will notice we say brother
and sister 'round here

It's because we're a family
and these folks are so near


When one has a heartache
we all share the tears

And rejoice in each victory
in this family so dear

Chorus
I'm so glad I'm a part
of the fam'ly of God

I've been washed in the fountain
cleansed by His blood


Joint heirs with Jesus
a we travel this sod

For I'm part of the fam'ly
the family of God

VERSE 2
From the door of an orphanage
to the house of the King

No longer an outcast
a new song I sing

From rags unto riches
from the weak to the strong

I'm not worthy to be here
but praise God I belong
