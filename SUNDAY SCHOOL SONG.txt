SUNDAY SCHOOL SONG

Every Sunday I love to go to  Sunday School

Where I learn about my Blessed Lord

Every Sunday I love to go to Sunday School

Where I hear God's Holy Word

I love my teachers they love  me
We're just like one big happy family

If I could only have my way I make it Sunday everyday

Every Sunday I love to go to Sunday School 

Where I give my off'rings ro the King

Every Sunday I love to go to Sunday School

Where I learn to praise and sing

Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness
 
And all these things shall be added unto you

Hallelu Halleluiah

Ask and it shall be given unto you

Seek and ye shall find

Knock and it shall be open unto you Hallelu Halleluiah

Halleluiah 3x
Hallelu Halleluiah
