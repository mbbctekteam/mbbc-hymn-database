Keep on the Firing Line
YP MEN

Verse 1
If you’re in the battle for the Lord and right,
Keep on the firing line;

If you win, my brother, surely you must fight,
Keep on the firing line;

There are many dangers that we all must face,
If we die still fighting it is no disgrace;

Cowards in the service will not find a place,
So keep on the firing line.

chorus
Oh, you must fight, be brave against all evil,
Never run, nor even lag behind;

If you would win for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line.

Verse 2
God will only use the soldier He can trust,
Keep on the firing line;

If you’ll wear a crown then bear the cross you must,
Keep on the firing line.

Life is but to labor for the Master dear,
Help to banish evil and to spread good cheer;

Great you’ll be rewarded for your service here,
So keep on the firing line.

chorus
Oh, you must fight, be brave against all evil,
Never run, nor even lag behind;

If you would win for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line.

Verse 3
When we get to heaven, brother, we’ll be glad,
Keep on the firing line;

How we’ll praise the Savior for the call we had,
Keep on the firing line;

When we see the souls that we have helped to win,
Leading them to Jesus, from the paths of sin,

With a shout of welcome, we will all march in,
So keep on the firing line.

chorus
Oh, you must fight, be brave against all evil,
Never run, nor even lag behind;

If you would win for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line.

chorus
Oh, you must fight, be brave against all evil,
Never run, nor even lag behind;

If you would win for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line.

If you would win for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line.
