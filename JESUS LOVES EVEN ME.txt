JESUS LOVES EVEN ME

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

I am so glad that our Father in heaven
Tells of His love in the Book He has given;

Wonderful things in the Bible I see,
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

Chorus
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

O, if there's only one song I can sing,
When in His beauty I see the great King,

This shall my song in eternity be:
O, what a wonder that Jesus loves me! 

Chorus
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me,

Jesus loves even me,

end
Jesus loves even me
